  "text": "There are good, sad, exemplary and well-educated neighbors in life. I know neighbors who can sometimes replace a person's closest people and even relatives. There are also neighbors who donate the most valuable things in life to a needy neighbor. Perhaps that is why there is a saying among the people: 'Don't buy a house, buy a neighbor.' All our actions are only the product of our own thinking. For better or for worse, we allow every good and bad deed for ourselves and those around us. 'From us, from us.' When we look back on our life, we realize that over the years, we have sometimes acted foolishly. It means that in the days of joy and misery, with the campaign and the decoration of the table, we are almost as far away as we can be, but we have never reached the finish line of our races.",
